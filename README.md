This is a Hugo based site deployed to Azure Storage + Azure Functions.

This is based on the work by Maxime Rouiller  in his blog post [here](https://blog.maximerouiller.com/post/go-go-hugo-blog-to-azure-storage/) and Pete Roden. You can fork the original hugo to Azure repository from https://github.com/codingwithsasquatch/hugoOnAzure.
